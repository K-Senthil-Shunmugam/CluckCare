# CNN Model for Image Classification

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented in TensorFlow/Keras for image classification. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images belonging to three different classes.

## Requirements

- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is located in the `DataSet` directory. It consists of images categorized into three classes. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture is based on the VGG architecture. It consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. The final layers include fully connected layers with ReLU activation and a softmax output layer for classification.

## Model Training

The model is trained using the training data generated using `ImageDataGenerator` from Keras. The training process is visualized using Matplotlib. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## Model Evaluation

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 96.51% on the validation set. Model evaluation metrics include loss and accuracy plotted over epochs.

## Usage

To use this model, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `Requirements` section.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the repository directory.
4. Run the training script.

```bash
python train_model.py
